Sliding window works only if this property holds:
When you expand the window, the condition moves in one direction.
When you shrink the window, the condition moves in the opposite direction.
In simpler terms:
Action	Effect must be
Expand window	Sum always increases
Shrink window	Sum always decreases
This is called monotonic behavior.

sliding window works for positive numbers. If there are negative numbers in the array use prefix sum pattern.
